### Notice!!!
To retrieve the saved models, follow this google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DH4-PfX7HcVTDARpSKZoqJyeEk3GnG5Q?usp=share_link     

To retrieve the CIFAR10 data, follow this google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wtWHP34Na-FT0SIB5ct9Y_ZDAYrYbcqW?usp=share_link    

Please download both files since my code uses them for the project.

***-Why are they in google drive?***  
Because the files are too big to be uploaded to github, and google drive
was the only solution I could find.  
Thank you for your understanding!
